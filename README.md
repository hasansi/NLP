# NLP Pipeline to build Spam Filter

In this project, I build an NLP pipeline by using the various NLP tools such as count vectorizer, stop words removal, TFIDF as well as the Naive Bayes classifier.

I'll use a classic dataset for this - UCI Repository SMS Spam Detection: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+pam+Collection

The model predicts spam at an accuracy of 0.9248020435242028
